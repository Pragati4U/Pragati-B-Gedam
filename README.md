# Eye Disease Detection using UNet Model for Image Segmentation with Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Methods

Eye disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, are major global health concerns that, if left untreated, can result in irreversible vision loss. Early identification and precise diagnosis are essential for managing and preventing visual impairment. Ophthalmologists do manual examinations as a major component of traditional diagnostic techniques, which can be laborious and prone to inter-observer variability. As a result, there is increasing interest in using developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to create automated systems for the diagnosis and detection of eye diseases.

Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image processing tasks in the last several years, especially in the ophthalmology domain. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to perform better in tasks including object identification, segmentation, and picture classification. Because it can capture both local and global properties while maintaining spatial information, the CNN architecture, known as UNet, has become a popular option for semantic segmentation tasks.

Segmentation of the optic disc and cup is important for the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma and other eye conditions. The optic disc, which is situated at the posterior pole of the eye and is crucial for determining the structural integrity of the retina, is where the optic nerve fibers enter the eye. The cup, or central depression inside the optic disc, is especially important for diagnosing glaucoma because variations in the ratio of the cup to the disc can show how the condition is progressing.

Using a UNet model for picture segmentation, this research study presents a unique way for automated eye illness identification in this setting, with an emphasis on optic disc and cup segmentation techniques. Our approach attempts to offer precise and effective identification of eye disorders from retinal fundus pictures by utilizing the potential of deep learning and sophisticated image processing techniques. In order to create computer-aided diagnosis systems that can identify and treat patients more effectively, it is imperative that the optic disc and cup regions be segmented.
